# Structuri
A school assignment to make a project in c++ using structures.

I have been assigned to do the project about rare matrices(composed mostly zeros). The purpose is to make a CLI program
which reads the data from a file and can read commands from the user to do simple arithmetics with the available matrices
like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and others.

Firstly it will be a mess in one file but I will try to make it organised in header files
In the future I will try to hopefully remake the project but using classes and operator overloading for the basic operation

#### Also sorry because the github will be in english and the project in romanian because the teachers want it in romanian (not necessarily but it should be)
